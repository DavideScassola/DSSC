If you want to generate the executables you have to load:
- intel compiler module
- mpi module
then you can compile through the Makefile (make all).

overlapping.x takes as parameter the dimension of the identity matrix to generate (default is 9).
ex: mpirun -np 10 overlapping.x 120

If the input size is bigger than 9, then the identity matrix will be written on a binary file.
Anyway, in both cases the program prints the matrix in order to check the correctness.
