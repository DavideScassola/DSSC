If you want to generate the executables you have to load:
- intel compiler module
- mpi module
then you can compile through the Makefile (make all).

pi_MPI.x takes as parameter the number of iterations used to compute pi.
ex: mpirun -np 10 pi_MPI.x 1000000000

pi_OMP.x instead takes as parameter just the number of threads,
and the number of iterations is fixed to 10^9.
ex: pi_OMP.x 10
